# Speak, Ifá — Reclaiming the Lineage

A premium, decolonial digital repository dedicated to the restoration and preservation of Yorùbá cosmology. Grounded in the ancient **Odù Ifá**, this project translates ancestral logic into actionable modern wisdom, stripping away colonial caricatures to reveal the mathematical laws of the universe.

## 🏺 The Vision

In a world filled with "Victorian interpretation," **Speak, Ifá** serves as a sacred archive. We meet the Òrìṣà not as folklore or myth, but as living DNA—the original blueprint for a life of character (*Ìwà*) and power (*Aṣẹ*).

## 🛠 Features

- **Decolonial Archives**: Deep-dive articles on Eṣù, Àjẹ́, and Orí, restored to their original philosophical contexts.
- **Cosmological Glossary**: A dynamic, educational reference for foundational Yorùbá metaphysical terms.
- **Robust Search**: Diacritic-insensitive matching that respects the tonal complexity of the Yorùbá language.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: A luxury, glassmorphic UI designed to reflect the sophistication of the lineage.
- **Sacred Connection**: A dedicated "Connect" portal governed by the "Protocol of Engagement."

## 🚀 Technical Stack

- **Core**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with TailwindCSS utilities
- **Typography**: Playfair Display (Serif) & Inter (Sans)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Dynamics**: Framer Motion & CSS Micro-animations
